Description: Designed to emulate certain traits of the tidy data modification pipeline seen in the tidyverse suite of packages. However, sidewindr is aimed at a specifically base-R implementation and aims to create these data modification and selection pipelines without the introduction of new classes or non base-R concepts such as tibbles. Designed to require as few other dependencies as possible.
