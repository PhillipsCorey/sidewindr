# Installation
to install `sidewindr`, please download `sidewindr.zip` using the green code button above or download the files by cloning the repository. Once you have the code on your personal machine, and move the `sidewindr` folder and all of its contents into the folder your version of R uses to store installed packages. If you are unsure of what folder this is, you can find it using the `.libPaths()` function in your R terminal. Once you have moved the `sidewindr` folder to your library path, you should be able to call `library('sidewindr')` to mount it like any other R package.
