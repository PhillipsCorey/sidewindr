# sidewindr
an R package meant to be a tidyverse/dplyr-esque package angled at being more friendly towards base R.

# Installation
to install `sidewindr`, please download the `sidewindr` folder and move it and all of its contents into the folder your version of R uses to store installed packages. If you are unsure of what folder this is, you can find it using the `.libPaths()` funciton. Once you have moved the `sidewindr` folder to your library path, you should be able to call `library('sidewindr')` to mount it like any other R package.
